There's something interesting about this. It's only a few steps removed from creating a wordpress site, or the like, but it was infinitely more satisfying. 

I deployed a site from the command line, linked it to my Github, then connected it to Netlify's CMS. Weird, right? Again, it sounds like it's only a few steps removed from clicking "Launch Site!" from Wordpress, but I know it was only as simple as it was because of the prior years of experience I've built up. The dev environment I've put together (sloppily) that made it so I could just hack some things into the command line and create this bad boy. 

So, what's my mission, here?

I'm going to try to make this into something real. I won't write in it every single day, but I'm going to write in it. At least twice a week, or whenever I do something major that deserves an entry. It's a dev blog, it's a personal development blog, it's a guitar practice blog, it's a repository of my opinions on TV shows (Fargo's great, btw. Good taste, future Chris). 

So with that, I'm going to get back to playing around with Gatsby and trying to make this thing pretty.
