The police detonated an "audible distraction device" near my apartment and I, stupidly, thought it was thunder. Just one more of the little holdovers from being raised in the monsoon capital of the country. Did you hear a bang? Is the sky grey? It's thunder. No other explanation necessary. 

Moving on.

I have A Plan(tm) on how to style this thing. And by "A Plan" I mean, "I asked the folks at my company who work with React what they use for styling, and then I asked some people on the Discord what _they_ use for styling" annnnd survey says?

React and Sass! Resass! Sassact! Whatever you want to call them, that's the mojo baby (apparently). 

So, that's not much of a step, though. Figuring out a tool? Who gives a shit, right? It's like saying "gonna paint my living room today, decided I'm going to be using a roller and a drip-tray to do the job". And fine, that may be technically correct, but a big part of this is that I'm not rushing myself. I'm not doing this for work, it's a tool for relaxation and that means not forcing myself to jump ahead. 

Roller and drip-tray. Now, I just need to pick out the colors.
